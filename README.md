# Phone_Price_Prediction

Using "Cleaned_all_phones"  data and machine learning model to predict the price based on features of the phone.





Key questions we wanted to answer:
* Have average prices for brands changed over the years?
* Can we predict price based only on inflation?
* Does the price depend on the features of the phone?
* Can We Predict Prices Using Machine Learning Techniques like RainForestRegression?
